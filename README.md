# Synthetic-Graphs
---
This is the repository where we can put our code for the Synthetic graph stuff<br>
I haven't added too much currently, so feel free to add more!
## Directory
---
- The data folder contains all the data obtained from test runs.<br>
- The docs folder contains the documentation.<br>
- The result folder contains important plots generated by the test runs.<br>
- The script folder contains all the code to analyze data and produce the plots. It also contains the jupyter notebooks implementation of various SBMs.<br>
- The src folder contains modules that generate synthetic data, various Neural Network Architectures to operate on said data, and miscellaneous functions. These are found in the generate_data.py, models.py, and utils.py respectively.<br>
- The tests folder contains models that test each step of the process and are able to plot the results found in data<br>
## Notes:
- The Scaled versions of the 7-class GNNs areof size 24000 and not 24200 like the rest of them
## Particular things to look at with plots(Headlines)
- Some models are able to always exceed or at least approximate a Neural Network, the same is not true for spectral methods
- Weak recovery phase transitions take on a particular shape for each model and we able to see that in each plot
- Powerlaw distributions outperform uniform distributions
- Transformers and SAGE are able to utilize negative edge information(heterophily) more successfully than GCN and GAT are able to.
- We can very acutely compare the Dissasortative and Assortative cases.
