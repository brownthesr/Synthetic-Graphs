# Main Script files
The are the python scripts that we used to generate our results. They are organized as follows:
- store_data.py is our main file for computing the accuracy regimes
- scramble_sbms.py is our file for modifying existing benchmarks
- imitate_dataset.py is our file for approximating existing benchmarks with an SBM
- run_slurm.txt is an example slurm file of how to run our program
