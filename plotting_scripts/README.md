# Plotting Scripts
This file contains the plotting scripts for our trials. They function as follows:
- main_transformer_plot.py creates figure 1 of the transformer trials
- synthetic_benchmarks.py creates figure 3 and plots the accuracy of each of the synthetic benchmarks
- DC_multi_architectures.py creates figure 2
- 7_class.py plots the performance of these models over 7 classes, sadly not included in the paper
- the appendix files plot all of the figures found in the appendix
